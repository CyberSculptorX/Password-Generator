# Secrets-Password-Generator
The Password Generator ensures secure passwords with a minimum length of 16 characters, preventing manual input by using buttons for adjustments. High-entropy passwords are generated with the secrets module from a diverse character set. Users can exit with the 'Esc' key, and passwords are saved to the Downloads folder without revealing the path.
